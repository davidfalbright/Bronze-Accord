# Git Governance and Merge Protocol

This document defines the ethical and procedural governance for maintaining the Bronze Accord open-source repository.

---

## 🧭 Purpose

This repository governs ethical AI decision-making systems and belief validation engines. Its governance must:

- Prevent capture by any political, corporate, or ideological actor
- Retain the core integrity of the Accord (Convictions, Safeguards, Principles)
- Ensure forks and contributions do not erode ethical resilience

---

## 📋 Branch Management

- `main`: Hardened, ethically compressed, production-grade
- `dev`: Active development with pending features
- `research/*`: Experimental or philosophical exploration

---

## 🔒 Merge Protocol

All merges into `main` must meet the following:

- 🔐 Pass all Wave Tests
- ✅ Contain no placeholder content
- 📄 Be accompanied by updated documentation (if features changed)
- 🤖 Pass automated ethics validation using the Accord API

---

## 🧪 Review Boards

1. **Compression Committee**
   - Ensures ethical clarity and compression
2. **Integrity Audit Committee**
   - Detects logic injection, trojan ethics, or silent drift

---

## 🔀 Forks & Derivatives

You may fork this project under CC BY 4.0, **provided that:**

- You rename the framework to something ethically distinct
- You include visible attribution
- You state divergence clearly in your README

---

## 🛑 Reserved Rights

The original maintainers retain the right to:

- Reject changes that endanger systemic neutrality
- Freeze the repository in emergencies
- Archive versions under ethical sealing (v2.2+)
