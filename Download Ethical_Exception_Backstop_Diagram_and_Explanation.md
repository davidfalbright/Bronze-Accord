## Narrative Explanation

The **Ethical Exception Backstop** is a safeguard system embedded within the Bronze Accord Ethical Framework. It is invoked when the system encounters a **fractured verdict**â€”meaning a scenario where multiple ethical elements return contradictory or diametrically opposed responses (commonly labeled as a "Diametric Struggle").

The backstop performs the following steps:

1. **Check for Predefined Exceptions**  
   Attempts to match the current dilemma to a known ethical exception. If matched, the exception rule is applied.

2. **Fallback Logic Engagement**  
   If no exception matches, it engages successive fallback logic options (e.g., conviction prioritization, historical precedent weighting, or AI advisor meta-consensus).

3. **Loop and Retry if Viable**  
   If fallback options yield coherent verdicts, the system continues to offer them. This loop prevents paralysis.

4. **Escalation Pathway**  
   If all fallback options are exhausted and no stable ethical judgment can be reached, the system **escalates** the dilemma to:
   - a human supervisor (in hybrid systems),
   - a higher-order ethical AI,
   - or pauses to request additional data if resolution is possible through clarification.

This mechanism ensures that **ethical decision-making is never left in a broken or indeterminate state** and reinforces system trustworthiness even in adversarial or ambiguous domains.

## Glossary Entry

**Ethical Exception Backstop**  
*A recursive fallback and escalation system that engages when verdict logic produces a fractured or ambiguous ethical result. It attempts structured recovery and, if unsuccessful, triggers ethical escalation to higher layers.*
