# The Bronze Accord: Ethical Framework for Human-Aligned AI

Welcome to the official GitHub repository for the **Bronze Accord**, an open-source ethical framework designed to guide the development, deployment, and governance of AI systems that serve humanity with dignity, restraint, and accountability.

---

## 🔰 Project Vision

The Bronze Accord provides a **multi-layered ethical structure** rooted in deeply held convictions and reinforced by practical safeguards. It is designed to resist capture, manipulation, and ethical erosion over time, while supporting transparency, resilience, and human-aligned decision-making in AI.

This framework is:
- 🧠 AI-readable and machine-validated
- 📖 Human-legible and publicly auditable
- 🛡️ Resistant to misuse or unethical override
- 🧭 Informed by comparative religious and philosophical analysis
