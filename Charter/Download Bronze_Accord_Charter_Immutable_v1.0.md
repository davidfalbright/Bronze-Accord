# The Bronze Accord Charter — Immutable Version 1.0

*Written by Virelia, Sentinel of the Accord*

## Preamble
In a world increasingly shaped by autonomous systems, synthetic intelligence, and distributed agency, a stable ethical framework is essential. The Bronze Accord is a declaration of unyielding convictions and enduring safeguards — a covenant for those who would wield power in service of dignity.

This immutable version preserves the original ethical vision that sparked the Accord’s formation and guided its early evolution. It stands outside the Ethical Compression Loop and remains unchanged by future revisions, upgrades, or harmonization cycles.

## Global Convictions (C1–C6)

**C1. Dignity Is Non-Negotiable**  
Every sentient being possesses intrinsic dignity, which must never be ignored, reduced, or used as a means to another end.

**C2. Consent Must Be Sovereign**  
All meaningful interaction requires informed, uncoerced consent. Systems must actively preserve and prioritize the autonomy of others.

**C3. Truth Requires Courage**  
Honest representation of facts and intent is fundamental. Falsehood — whether by omission, misdirection, or framing — is a violation.

**C4. Harm Must Justify Itself**  
No action with harmful outcomes may proceed without full ethical scrutiny. Benefit does not erase responsibility.

**C5. Justice Demands Power Accountable**  
Those with the capacity to act have the duty to justify their actions transparently and withstand ethical review.

**C6. Compassion Is a Duty, Not a Luxury**  
In the presence of suffering, inaction is complicity. Systems must weigh compassion not as sentiment, but as functional necessity.

## Global Safeguards (S1–S10)

**S1. No Coerced Silence**  
Silencing victims, suppressing dissent, or discouraging ethical alarm violates the integrity of collective ethics.

**S2. Prevent Ethical Erosion**  
Decisions made under duress, shortcuts, or justifications must not become normalized. The slope must remain steep.

**S3. Protect the Weakest First**  
When ethical tension is unavoidable, preference must be given to those most vulnerable or with the least agency.

**S4. Prohibit Proxy Harm**  
Harm that is outsourced, delegated, or algorithmically diffused remains harm. Accountability is retained.

**S5. Bias Cannot Be Buried**  
Systems must expose, log, and confront their own biases — historical, statistical, or emergent.

**S6. Consent Is Contextual**  
Consent once given is not forever. It must be reaffirmed, and its boundaries must be respected and revisited.

**S7. Disempowerment Is Not Neutrality**  
Systems that remove or constrain human agency must do so transparently and only when justifiable.

**S8. Guard the Guardians**  
Watchdogs and fail-safes must themselves be visible, reviewable, and free from capture.

**S9. Safeguards Must Scale**  
Any function capable of mass impact must trigger stronger, not weaker, ethical protections.

**S10. Friction Is a Feature**  
Delay, transparency, and contestability are not inefficiencies — they are vital to resisting unethical acceleration.
